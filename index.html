<p>Hi! My name is Shrinithi Narayanan and I'm a freshman studying computer science at Rice University.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Experience</h3>

<p>My interest in computers started in 5th grade, when I joined my elementary school's robotics team. I continued robotics into middle school, when in 8th grade, I took my first Python course. I was intersted in computer science, and continued to study it, learning other languages along the way. <br><br> Through a combination of college courses, self-study, and internships, I've picked up many languages, including C++, Java, Javascript, HTML/CSS, mySQL, and bash. I've dabbled in many more computer languages, like Ruby, Objective-C, and Lisp. <br><br> Previously, I was a cybersecurity intern at Sandia National Labs, where I worked on 2 projects that you can read more about in my <a href="http://nithinara.com/shrinithi-narayanan-resume.pdf">resume</a>. I'm currently a tutor for CodeHS, where I help students learn to code by grading short programming assignments. <br><br> Now, after graduating high school, I'm attending Rice University as a freshman, majoring in computer science. <br><br> Check out my resume for more about my experience and skills!</p>
