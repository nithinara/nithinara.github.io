Cubing is simply solving twisty puzzles. Speedcubing is trying to solve them as fast as you can. I first learned how to solve a Rubik's cube from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yU-EwlRRvc&list=PL6CD08F940E40DCDB).

After learning how to solve a 3x3, I moved on to the 4x4, which had a new set of challenges. I eventually worked my way up to a 7x7 cube.

I even tried my hand at some competitions. Check out my fastest times on the offical [WCA website](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2010NARA01).
