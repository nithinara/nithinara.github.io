title: This website

After graduating from college and working, I found it hard to have much time for personal projects. I've had this domain for many years, and hadn't updated it for a long, long time. I decided to revamp my website to showcase more about me.

This website is built using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I used [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) to get this custom domain.

It was a breeze setting everything up! There was lots of documentation to help guide me, and now my website looks clean and loads fast.
